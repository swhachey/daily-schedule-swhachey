# daily-schedule-swhachey

A Daily Schedule to input your to-dos for the day as to not lose track of time.

Simply find the hour you'd like to scheudle your event and input it into the form. The result will show up in that hour's row. It is also stored in local storage.

The color of the row pertains to that hour block's reliativity to the current time. If that hour block has passed for the day it is grey, if its current its red, if its upcoming its green.

If I could go back and had more time, I'd condense and refactor my code by a lot to include functions to run the reptative code in way less lines. I'd also try and make the locally stored key, value pairs stay appended in the row after refresh. Lastly, I'd try and get the current date and time at the top to automatically refresh itself.

This was an informative and difficult homework.
